This course will focus on the history of humankind’s relationship with
the environment.  We use the word “environment” to refer to the nonhuman
components of the natural world.  We will examine how environmental
factors have shaped the development and growth of civilizations around
the world and analyze how these civilizations have altered their
environments in positive and negative ways.  The course will be
structured chronologically.  Each unit will include representative
primary-source documents that illustrate important overarching themes,
such as how early humans adapted natural resources for new purposes, how
the expansion of civilizations led to environmental changes, how the
interaction between European explorers and Native Americans led to
significant and unexpected environmental consequences, and how modern
societies have responded to environmental problems that threaten the
well-being of humans and the environment.  By the end of the course, you
will better understand the reciprocal relationship between human beings
and the environment and how this relationship has evolved throughout
human history. Notes:
-   Most audio resources have alternative written transcripts (except
    for YouTube resources that are not close-captioned for the hearing
    impaired).
-   Typescript pagination is different from published work.  A
    typescript will be 1/3 to 1/2 longer than the same document will be
    when published.  Please take this into account when noting page
    lengths of assignments.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

-   Define environmental history, and identify the relationship of
    environmental history with other disciplines and sub-disciplines.
-   Think critically about the historical relationship between humans
    and the environment.
-   Identify how early humans modified and adapted natural resources for
    agricultural and commercial purposes.
-   Analyze how human settlements altered the environment, and evaluate
    how environmental factors shaped the growth of early civilizations.
-   Evaluate how new agricultural and commercial practices altered the
    environment across the globe during the Middle Ages.
-   Evaluate how the Columbian Exchange resulted in significant
    ecological and biological changes in Europe and the Americas and
    dramatically altered human societies on both sides of the Atlantic
    Ocean.
-   Identify how environmental factors, such as disease and pollution,
    shaped political and social life across the globe in various
    historical times.
-   Analyze the impact of industrialization on human society during the
    Modern Era, and evaluate how governmental and nongovernmental actors
    have attempted to ameliorate the negative environmental consequences
    of industrialization.
-   Explain how technology and urbanization mediated interactions
    between humans and the environment historically and contemporarily. 
-   Identify current environmental challenges facing humanity, and
    analyze these challenges from a historical perspective.
-   Explain how environmental consequences have been born unequally by
    different segments of society, such as classes, ethnicities, and
    races.
-   Analyze and interpret primary and secondary source documents
    relating to environmental history using historical research methods.

### Course Information

Welcome to HIST364.  Below, please find some general information on the
course and its requirements.  
  
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   Radford University: Professor Bill Kovarik’s [“Environmental History
    Timeline”](http://www.radford.edu/~wkovarik/envhist/)
-   K. J. W. Oosthoek’s [Environmental History
    Resources](http://www.eh-resources.org/environmental_history.html)
-   Dr. Steven Kreis’s [*The History Guide: Lectures on Ancient and
    Medieval Europe*](http://www.historyguide.org/ancient/ancient.html)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Units 1 and 2, as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
latter units.  You will also need to complete the Final Exam.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the quizzes and problem sets listed above.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **153
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take approximately 20.5 hours to
complete.  Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete sub-subunits 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 (a total of 4.25 hours) on Monday;
sub-subunits 1.1.3 through 1.1.5 and subunit 1.2 (a total of 5 hours) on
Tuesday; etc.
