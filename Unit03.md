**Unit 3: The Middle Ages** <span id="3"></span> 
*Following the fall of the Roman Empire, c. 462 CE, European
civilization felt a power vacuum.  The Celtic tribes of Europe had
hastened the death of Rome, which had been Christianized in the fourth
century CE by Roman Emperor Constantine the Great.  Constantine had also
moved his capital from Rome to the former Bosphorus city of Byzantium,
renaming the city Constantinople, and he started his reign in post-Roman
Europe.  Following Rome’s sacking in 462 CE by the Visigoth Theodoric
II, Rome’s influence over European politics waned, which led to the
ascendance of both the Catholic Church and local monarchies across
Europe.  
  
 Much of the scholarship produced by the ancient, pre-Christian world
was neglected by both the Church and by largely illiterate local power
centers.  The Church carved out for itself, through the exclusivity of
education in Latin, a monopoly on ideas that extended into the
Reformation.  The relationship between humans and the natural world was
limited to local superstition or the Bible until the St. Thomas Aquinas
returned the exiled pagan philosophers the European intellectual canon
in the 13th century CE, which led to the rise of science. 
Christianity’s stranglehold on the medieval mind was fundamentally
shaken when it could not supply answers for the horrors of the Black
Death of the 14th century.  The scale of that natural disaster was such
that it shook society to its foundations.*

     Instructions: Note that this reading is optional.  Please read the
    entire linked essay.  Social immobility is one feature of medieval
    thought.  Peasants were tied to the land or to their masters in a
    life-long apprenticeship program.  Because of tithes owed to the
    land lord or the Church, shortage was very much a part of medieval
    life.  Although the forests were off limits to those not of noble
    birth, poaching was widespread, as hunting was one way to supplement
    a meager diet.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the lecture
    in its entirety.  The Black Death fundamentally altered the culture
    and economy of Medieval Europe.  Europe lost over 25 percent of its
    population, which created labor shortages and altered power
    relationships among peasants, nobles, and the Church.  Peasants
    began to overthrow the yoke of feudal ties to the land, especially
    since whole areas were depopulated, and they began to demand social
    mobility and political freedoms.  The Church, which had long
    dominated the medieval world view and had suppressed observational
    scientific study in favor of revealed truth, lost its vise grip on
    the medieval imagination, because scripture could neither explain
    the plague not protect the faithful from it.

    centuries’ old manorial estates.  This created population pressures
    as dispossessed farmers flock to the cities to look for work, which
