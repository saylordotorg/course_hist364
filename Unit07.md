**Unit 7: Threatened Environments – Threatened Societies** <span
id="7"></span> 
*At the end of the twentieth century, over one hundred years of
unrestrained industrial growth and unlimited consumption of fossil fuels
took such a toll on the global environment that failure to notice became
no longer possible and no longer politically or economically viable. 
Overuse of natural resources and non-regulation of market economies had
pushed many species to extinction, had made many environments unlivable,
and had impacted human societies.  Large industry impacted large
ecosystems, and despite their technology, humans are still a part of
ecosystems.  Ecosystem threats will eventually become social threats. 
Ultimately, large scale manufacture has had a profound effect on the
global environment.  Industrial pollutions inflict communities; public
health is under severe threat.  While an expansive population exerts
huge pressure on the planet, not only natural resources exhaust, but
also the entire climatic system undergoes changes.  Climate change in
turn affects the human society by way of abnormal weather patterns that
lead to catastrophes.  This unit will explore how a global economy has
had a global environmental impact.*

     Instructions: Please click on each of the 5 sections, examine the
    graphic, and read the entire text for each: “The Disappearance of
    the Aral Sea;” “Lake Chad: Almost Gone;” “The Mekong River -
    Survival for Millions;” “Water - Cooperation or Conflict?;” and
    “Transboundary Water Governance - Averting Conflict.”  Water use is
    poised to be one of the most contentious political issues.  Minority
    rights and demands of the wealthy in the Americas and the Pacific
    Basin, conflicting interests of newly created nations in semi-arid
    Central Asia, population pressures leading to active desalinization
    in the desert Middle East, and world-wide pollution of freshwater
    have made protecting water sources a global issue.  The UNEP link
    provides a short overview to some of the biggest environmental
    issues created by water diversion, the most dramatic of which is the
    disappearing Aral Sea.  The Salton Sea in California lies at the
    other extreme as a result of a century of large-scale water
    diversion.

    Media, Human Health, and Environmental Effects,” and read the entire
    linked webpages.  Pollution has always been a result of technology,
    but before industrialization and population explosion, the global
    impact of environmental pollution was limited.  Storing hazardous
    waste – the deadly chemical or radioactive byproduct of complex
    chemical processes used in manufacturing, healthcare, mining, and
    energy production – has become an increasingly fractious issue,
    largely due to illegal dumping of waste in rivers, the oceans, and
    landfills near human habitation.  This waste dumping has usually
    been at the expense of politically powerless populations like the
    poor and minorities.  Finding a safe place to store this waste and
    eventual need for site maintenance or cleanup is a worldwide
    problem.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read this entire
    article.  This article by biologists Paul and Anne Ehrlich evaluates
    the social impact of Paul Ehrlich’s 1968 book *The Population
    Bomb. * In the 1968 work, Ehrlich argues that unchecked world
    population growth would lead to epidemic starvation by the 1970s. 
    Paul and Anne Ehrlich argue in their 2009 article that the original
    book may have overstated the impact that population growth would
    have on world food resources, but that population growth still
    threatens the health of the environment due to pollution, greenhouse
    gas production, and other problems.  The authors argue that
    concerted action must be taken to limit population growth and
    encourage environmental sustainability.

    the Table of Contents on the left side of the webpage. 
    Alternatively, you may navigate by using the arrow buttons at the
    bottom of each page.  Population density and population distribution
    are two elements of land use and human health.  Urbanization grew
    enormously worldwide in the twentieth century, increasing population
    density that cause dramatic shifts in land use.  Migrations of
    populations are based in both push and pull factors.  When people
    choose to migrate from one place or another, usually a combination
    of factors is pushing them from their homes – anything from war to
    natural disaster to unemployment – and pulling them to a new
    place – refuge, services, and jobs.  The *Atlas of Population and
    Environment* gives a geographical view of population density and its
    environmental impact.  Though some of the statistics in this source
    are outdated, it provides a comprehensive overview of the population
    pressure and its environmental impacts.  By reading through this
    source, you should be able to form a clear idea of the current
    population issue.

     Instructions: Please read the linked essay.  Poor regulation of
    dumping of industrial chemicals in the years before the founding of
    the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and passing of
    environmental regulatory legislation led to horrors like those that
    befell innocent homeowners in an upstate New York subdivision.  In
    the 1970s, an explosion exposed the fact that their development had
    been built on a landfill where industrial waste had been dumped in
    the 1950s.  The *New York Times* reported, “Twenty five years after
    the Hooker Chemical Company stopped using the Love Canal here as an
    industrial dump, 82 different compounds, 11 of them suspected
    carcinogens, have been percolating upward through the soil, their
    drum containers rotting and leaching their contents into the
    backyards and basements of 100 homes and a public school built on
    the banks of the canal.”  221 families, many of whom are plagued
    with cancer and birth defects, had to be relocated.
