**Unit 1: Human Beings and Their Environment** <span id="1"></span> 
*One of the defining characteristics of humanity is the ability to make
and use tools.  From the earliest uses to provide shelter, safety, and
food to organized and cooperative efforts that are hallmarks of human
society – horticulture, husbandry, domestication, and agriculture –
humans shape the physical world they live in.  Differing and changing
environments have always shaped human society in complex and subtle
ways.  Environmental historian Timothy Silver claims that environmental
history is history “with the animals left in,” but it is a great deal
more than that.  Environmental history is the story of humans as
biological creatures who interact with ecosystems on the planet.  
  
 In this unit, you will examine how humans interact with the environment
from pre-history (pre-writing) while pursuing a definition of
environmental history.  You will also explore Malthusian population
theory, an influential theory discussing the relationship between
population growth and limits of natural resources that may be in play in
human populations, even though humans have insulated themselves from
other environmental pressures.  Finally, you will discover how some
early civilizations manipulated the natural world to their advantage and
how disasters might have contributed to the civilizations’ decline.*

    the article, and click on “PDF” to open the document.  This article
    originally appeared in *The New York Times* on April 3, 1999. 
    Cronon argues that indigenous peoples, like the Native Americans who
    occupied the land prior to European colonization, interact with
    their environment in the same ways that all humans do.  As Cronon
    explained in his landmark *Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists,
    and the Ecology of New England,*  Native Americans were or are
    somehow more “natural” than more technically advanced societies,
    though those societies tend to deny, as a group, the  unique
    humanity of Native Americans.  This resource also applies to

    America may have navigated along the coast of what is now North and
    South America even before the people named “Clovis” crossed the
    Bering Land Bridge.  The pre-Clovis people traveled south, below the
    ice sheet that covered most of North America.  Inhospitable climate
    determined the path of their migration and settlement.
