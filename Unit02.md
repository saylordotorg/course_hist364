**Unit 2: Ancient Civilizations and their Environments** <span
id="2"></span> 
*About 10,000 years ago, former hunting and gathering human populations
developed large-scale agriculture from horticulture and husbandry in an
area that archaeologists call “the fertile crescent” or Mesopotamia, the
area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which is now south eastern
Turkey and Iraq.  Agriculture created food abundance, which allowed
leisure time, the predicate of a stratified culture.  Because not every
member of an agricultural society needs to be engaged in the active
production of food, classes of scholars, priests, and law emerged, which
require the invention of writing.  Agriculture begat cities like ancient
Babylon, as well as the somewhat later Nile and East Asian societies. 
Although each human society is unique, some of these first civilizations
have similarities, especially in regards to the commodification of
resources and resulting trade, resource depletion, and religion.  In
this unit, you will examine the ways in which early (and later) ancient
civilizations, having harnessed the potential benefits of agriculture,
shaped and were shaped by their environments.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the entire
    article.  In this essay, historian K.J.W. Oosthoek analyzes how
    various civilizations throughout human history have used wood. 
    Oosthoek also discusses how deforestation and subsequent climate
    change adversely affected various civilizations in the Middle East,
    Asia, and parts of Western Europe.  He concludes that modern society
    should consider these historical precedents as it harvests wood from
    the Amazon basin and various parts of Southeast Asia.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the entire
    essay.  Noted environmental historian Donald Worster discusses
    “instrumentalism” and “the intrinsic tradition” in human thinking
    about the environment.  According to him, instrumental thinking uses
    the idea of conquest as the correct metaphor to describe human
    relationship to natural resources.  Those who think intrinsically
    tend to anthropomorphize nature, but it also leads people to see
    inherent worth in conservation, informed by scientific study of
    ecology and not mere exploitation.  Worster concludes that cultural
    change must precede conservation efforts.

    hosts the forces of civilization, brought by domestication and
    fecund agriculture.  These are often found embodied in an earth
    mother goddess.

    Africans.  In addition to trade, the article also presents a vivid
    picture of other aspects of the African societies, including the
    customs, slave trade, etiquette, and the spread of Islam.  Please

    changes in those domains shaped and reshaped the trade.
