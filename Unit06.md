**Unit 6: Reshaping the Modern Environment** <span id="6"></span> 
*Industrialization led to the institutionalization of market-powered
economic capitalism.  Economies were no longer designed to be
self-sustaining.  Industrial economies could only grow if markets were
continually generated so that production could be continually expanded. 
This process of market expansion and production shaped modern
environments.  Market expansion took place in non-industrial societies,
which introduced industrialization in order to make profits and extract
raw materials.  Once materials were exhausted, new sources had to be
found, often at the expense of pre-industrial societies.  The very
system of exploitation, production, and consumption came to be the
ruling idea that cannot be challenged.  Technology became the new god
and capitalism the new religion.  
  
 As societies became fully industrialized, every action had profound
environmental effects.  In the twentieth century, generation of energy
to support production and new populations centered around manufacturing,
transportation on a macro level, agribusiness, and commerce, which all
proceeded based only on economic need and desire with very little
reflection on environmental consequences.  Of course, political
necessity rivaled economics as a source of motivation, and the
technological wars of the twentieth century had a dramatic impact on the
natural world.  This unit will explore the changes wrought by modern
faith in the elevation of economics and politics over natural systems.*

     Instructions: Please read the entire primary source excerpt. 
    Although James refers to himself in the third person, this is a
    chapter from his autobiography.  In “The Virgin and the Dynamo,”
    Adams reflects on the motivational power of technology in building
    modern urban civilization as similar to the power of the cult of the
    Virgin Mary to inspire the building of medieval cathedrals.  The
    dynamo (symbolizing technology) has become the new icon to which
    shrines are built and dedicated.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the entire
    article.  A significant feature of developed societies is a network
    of high quality road systems that permit people to live in places
    far from concentrated population centers or far from mass transit
    systems.  One yardstick of economic health is the number of new
    housing starts recorded each year.  Rather than rehabilitate
    traditional population centers, new housing statistics indicate how
    much former forest or farmland is being converted to paved surfaces.
     Highways that allow commuting enable developers to push housing
    complexes farther afield, diffusing population and inviting
    subsequent support development to follow.  This reading provides the
    history of the national highway idea.

    and political friendliness to environmental degradation.  Whereas
    industrialization first occurred in Western Europe and the United
    States, these societies now identify as post-industrial.  Cessation
    of manufacturing has left abandoned factories and other industrial
    artifacts in “rust belts” in much of the U.S. and British
    Commonwealth.  This reading and “Shaping the Earth: European Theme

    Portland State University, Bill Lang, discusses how human activity
    has dramatically altered the Columbia River system in the
    northwestern United States.  400 dams designed for hydroelectric
    power generation and irrigation purposes have turned the once mighty
    river and its tributaries into a series of manmade lakes.  These
    dams have had a severe impact on aquatic life in the river basin. 
    For example, the population of Pacific salmon species, which once
    filled the river during the spring and fall runs, has declined
    precipitously during the past half-century and may never recover.

    River breaks into distributaries and empties into the Gulf of
    Thailand.  The subtropical area is largely agricultural and
    aquacultural and boasts remarkable biodiversity.  Because of a
    series of wars in Vietnam over the twentieth century and a closed
    society that reacted to those wars, the Delta has not been developed
    industrially.  Biggs discusses the relationship between the long
    U.S. involvement in Vietnam and the impact of nation building in the
    twenty-first century.

    is one of the richest countries, but standards of living are very
    low.  The extraction of petroleum is the primary concern for the
    mostly American and European oil companies that dominate the
    industry in Nigeria.  However, most of Nigerian oil is found under
    natural gas deposits.  Natural gas is more difficult to extract and
    returns profits more slowly than oil, so in a poor country, where
    corruption is rife and populations have virtually no power (and
    receive little or no economic benefits from oil extraction), instead
    of harvesting the natural gas first, oil companies simply burn the
    gas off in massive geysers of fire, which launch massive amounts of
    greenhouse gasses and particulate matter into the air.  Furthermore,
    people live in villages near these burnoffs and report serious
    effects from this wanton pollution.  Read and listen to the NPR
    broadcast to discover the conditions for people who had the
    misfortune to live near a deposit of oil and gas.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the brief
    entry.  Extensive agriculture is a system in which land is farmed
    with little labor, fertilizer, or capital expenditure in ratio to
    the area farmed.  Intensive agriculture is the opposite, where
    smaller land areas require much labor, fertilizer, and capital
    expenditure.  Intensive farming produces large crop yields, because
    fertilizer keeps the soil nutrient rich.  Agribusiness is an
    intensive agricultural model.  Extensive land use is best
    exemplified by nomadic cultures and horticulturalists.  Lower yields
    are expected in extensive land use, because soils are often depleted
    and a large area is needed to maintain a small number of people. 
    Subsistence farming is extensive.
