**Unit 8: Environmentalism: New Perspectives on Mankind’s Relationship
with the Natural World** <span id="8"></span> 
*Scientific awareness coupled with intense environmental degradation
inspired a backlash against total resource consumption and environmental
waste.  Beginning with the industrial revolutions, the modern
environmental movement has grown to offer sustainability as an alternate
paradigm for unrestricted resource consumption and waste generation. 
Nations that experienced industrialization from the eighteenth to
twentieth centuries are now considered to be post-industrial.  Concern
for protecting the environment is a feature of having moved into more
knowledge-based economies.  Yet, consumption has not lessened, so
manufacturing continues in nations currently in the midst of their own
industrialization.  Although the paradigm shift has been dramatic,
challenges remain.  This unit will explore the origins and outlines of
modern environmentalism and will explore some key issues for the
twenty-first century.*

    transcript of each video.  Click on “The Story behind the Story,”
    and read the “Post-Expedition Interview” conducted by Michael
    Heasley.  The Yellowstone Park fire of 1988 changed a lot of minds
    about whether human interference in conserving wild lands should
    include fire suppression.  The presence of human habitation
    determines when foresters allow fires to burn and when they fight
    them.  In the last 100 years, conservationists are seeing the
    results of their policies, and whether conservation policies have
    done more harm than good is unclear.  
      
     Listening to the broadcasts and reading the interview should take

    and political impact of environmentalist Rachel Carson’s 1962 book
    *Silent Spring.  *Carson had warned that indiscriminate use of
    chemical pesticides for farming and other purposes would endanger
    entire ecosystems and threaten human health.  Baker notes that the
    American chemical industry strongly objected to Carson’s arguments,
    but grassroots efforts by concerned citizens as a result of her
    book’s publication eventually led to national regulation of
    pesticides and other hazardous chemicals by the early 1970s.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and view the brief
    4-minute video.  Trading in carbon offsets has become a growth
    industry for investors.  Essentially, industries and even individual
    companies can buy the right to pollute.  Carbon offsets were
    suggested in the 1980s as a way to lower the overall emission of
    greenhouse gases.  A company that is successful in limiting its own
    greenhouse gases can raise capital by trading with a company that
    has not been able to lower its emissions.  Even though one company
    is polluting too much, the fact that another company is not
    polluting very much can, if levels are maintained, reduce overall
    carbon emissions.  The idea is controversial; some environmentalists
    say no one should be able to buy the right to pollute and that all
    industries should lower their emissions.
