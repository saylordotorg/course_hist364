**Unit 4: The Columbian Exchange** <span id="4"></span> 
*European exploration of the Americas began in the 10th century CE with
the voyages of Viking Leif Eriksson.  Although the settlement of what is
now Newfoundland failed after about sixty years, the Norse, as well as
the Portuguese, fished the area around the Grand Banks for the next 800
years.  Permanent settlement of South America and the Caribbean came in
the late 15th and early 16th centuries, following the voyages of
Christopher Columbus under the flag of Spain.  Portuguese, French, and
English colonization followed, and a triangle Atlantic trade quickly
grew.  Europeans shipped manufactured goods to Africa and the Americas,
slaves from Africa, and natural resources from the Americas.  Historian
Alfred Crosby named the international footprint of this resource trade,
“The Columbian Exchange.”  The Columbian Exchange dramatically affected
populations and environments on all three sides of the Triangle Trade. 
Europeans imported new species, resources, wealth, and slaves, while
Africa and the Americas were hugely depopulated by slavery and disease,
respectively, while Europeans imposed cultural assumptions about the
environment on the new landscapes, dramatically altering them in the
process.  This unit will explore the environmental, cultural,
demographic, and technological changes wrought by the Columbian
Exchange.*

    Thomas Grennes examines how the initial impact of the Columbian
    Exchange was to elevate Spain and Spanish America to an economic
    powerhouse but after the initial boom caused by exportation of raw
    materials from New Spain a bust followed.  British North America was
    initially considered to be a bust because, unlike in South America,
    the colonizers discovered no gold.  Nonetheless, the
    English-speaking Atlantic eventually triumphed economically in what
    Grennes calls “a reversal of fortune.”

    resulting from introduced species of disease are historically and
    scientifically verifiable, but the historical community is not in
    agreement over how many people lived in the Americas prior to mass
    colonization, so there is disagreement over how many died.  There is
    also contention over whether Europeans intentionally sought death on
    the scale that was achieved, whether the term “genocide” is
    appropriate.  Peter d’Errico believes that intentional eradication
    was very much a feature of European thinking regarding indigenous
    Americans; Guenter Lewy (below) disputes this.

    the Americas as slaves brought no possessions with them.  They did,
    however, bring culture and knowledge into bondage.  Whereas
    Europeans were not well adapted to living in hot and humid climates,
    African slaves had generations of experience to draw on, especially
    in farming and animal husbandry.  Europeans relied heavily on
    Africans’ technical know-how especially in the cultivation of cash
    crops like rice and indigo in the swamps of the southern English
    colonies.  Furthermore, many technologies uniquely adapted to
    conditions in the new colonies were adopted by Europeans.

     Instructions: Please click on the hyperlink titled “Read the first
    chapter (.pdf)” to open the PDF.  Please read the entire chapter (19
    pages total).  Slavery and the slave trade introduced many African
    cultures to the Americas and European culture.  Africans were forced
    to become Christians and taught only enough English, Spanish,
    French, or Portuguese to be able to understand commands from their
    owners.  Forced into insular and subservient societies, remnants of
    many African cultures gradually mixed with the dominant European
    cultures, irrevocably changing both.  Ironically, African American
    culture is now one of the biggest cultural exports from the Americas
    to the rest of the world, especially in the form of music.

    you may click on the link at the bottom of the webpage to open a

    originally published in William Cronon, ed., *Uncommon Ground:
    Rethinking the Human Place in Nature* (W. W. Norton, 1995),
    69­–90).  Please read the entire article.  Cronon discusses what he
    perceives as the wrongheadedness of trying to turn land “back” to
    wilderness.  Cronon argues that the American continent was not an
    “uninhabited wilderness” when Europeans colonized it; therefore,
    modern environmentalists are imposing a new idea on the land by
    attempting to make wilderness “pristine.”
