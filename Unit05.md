**Unit 5: Industrialization** <span id="5"></span> 
*World industrialization began in England in the eighteenth century and
spread to other countries and regions in Europe and the America.  Marked
especially by the burning of fossil fuels for energy, intensive
agriculture, the industrial revolutions fundamentally reorganized
society, hugely increased pollution, contributed to massive
deforestation (especially in the United States), and launched a wave of
internal migration to urban areas, international immigration to the
Americas, and forced transportation to Australia.  Industrialization
also contributed to secularization and the rise of experimental science,
social science, scientism, professionalization, colonization, modern
urbanization, formation of both a middle class and a working class, and
political reaction to degraded and immiserating conditions. 
Industrialization fundamentally reorders societies and dramatically
impacts environments and economies.  Industrialization as a process
continues at various speeds around the world.  This unit will explore
how industrialization was burgeoning with the rapid growth in scientific
knowledge and technological inventions.  You will analyze the social,
economic, political, and environmental significance of
industrialization.*

    pages total).  Enclosure of formerly communally-shared land forced
    many farm families to look for work in Europe’s cities.  This
    population shift was both a cause and effect of industrialization. 
    Population growth and density demanded increasingly intense
    agriculture, which in turn pushed subsistence farmers off the land. 
    Industrialization created jobs for the refugees but only the lowest
    wage jobs, which left families in immiserating conditions.  Even
    though they were often ultimately illusory, successes reported in
    overseas colonies pulled families to leave their home countries to
    seek better conditions overseas.

     Instructions: Please read the definition in its entirety.  Literary
    critic, Leo Marx, put forth a theory of American development in his
    pivotal text *The Machine in the Garden: Technology and the Pastoral
    Ideal.*  Although his method and conclusions are not universally
    accepted, his idea that the United States was romanticized at the
    end of the nineteenth century as an unspoiled pastoral paradise has
    much merit.  Although the United States emerged from its industrial
    period as a world economic power, in the early days, people debated
    industrialization as being counter to America’s essential nature as
    a nation of yeomen farmers and great natural beauty.  This
    description also applies to all readings in sub-subunit 5.3.1.

    webpage.  The rate of technological innovation and invention
    skyrocketed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in
    the U.S.  Labor practices, however, remained exploitative and
    unsafe.  New discoveries were not thoroughly investigated before
    being sent for manufacturing.  Lacking any governmental regulation
    of industry under concept of laissez faire capitalism, safety
    concerns for workers were left up to individual conscience.  The
    press, however, was situated to raise the alarm of harmful
    practices.  This chapter explores the role of the press in exposing
    the danger to workers in manufacturing that used the newly
    discovered element radium.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read entire
    webpage.  Noted environmental historian Donald Worster discusses the
    idea of “agrarianism,” which he defines as agriculture turned into a
    moral ideology.  British settlers in the U.S. long believed that
    “improving” the land gives it value.  Because Native Americans did
    not fence (enclose) and plow the land but rather shared the land
    communally for hunting or horticulture, colonists believed that they
    gave the land value by farming it and thus earned the right to claim
    ownership.  This idea that agriculture itself somehow bestows moral
    right in a given situation was fed by the yeoman ideal of Thomas
    Jefferson.  The 1930s disaster in the Midwest showed the limits of
    believing that farming itself is a moral right.
